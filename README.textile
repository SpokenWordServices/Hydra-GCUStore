h1. Hydrangea & the Hydra Framework

h2. Introduction and Installation Instructions

Hydrangea is the reference implementation of the Hydra framework, which builds on "Blacklight":http://projectblacklight.org, "ActiveFedora":http://yourmediashelf.com/activefedora and "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.org

For a more thorough overview of the Hydra framework, see "HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea/blob/master/HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile

h3. Prerequisites

Hydrangea requires Ruby version 1.8.7.  It will not run on Ruby 1.8.6.  If you need to upgrade Ruby, consider using "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ to do so, especially in your development environment.

Other Requirements:
* "git":http://git-scm.com/
* "rubygems":http://rubygems.org/pages/download
* "bundler":http://gembundler.com/ (gem install bundler)

h3. Basic installation & Running RSpec tests

This is based on Matt Zumwalt's "Hydra Stack: Getting Started":http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddrmhvjh_181gj9b7rcv notes from LibDevConX in March 2010.

Clone the git repository from github and pull the copy of jetty

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea.git
cd hydrangea
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

*Note:* _It's OK if 'git submodule init' returns 'No submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'vendor/plugins/blacklight/data'_

This will pull all of the code.  The 'git submodule update' command is pulling a copy of hydra-jetty into the jetty directory within hydrangea.

You are now in your working copy of hydrangea.  Use bundler to install the gem dependencies.

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

Run your database migrations (only need to do this once after cloning the git repository).
<pre>
rake db:migrate
rake db:migrate:plugins
</pre>

Now run the bundled copy of Jetty, which has Fedora and Solr installed & configured to work with Hydra.  We have created rake tasks to make this easier.  For a full listing of rake tasks provided by Hydra, run 

<pre>
rake --describe hydra
</pre>

<pre>
rake hydra:jetty:load
</pre>

Import the fixture objects that are used by the rspec and cucumber tests

<pre>
rake hydra:default_fixtures:load
</pre>

If you have already loaded these fixtures before, you should refresh them with 

<pre>
rake hydra:default_fixtures:refresh
</pre>

Run the Rspec tests to make sure everything is working properly.
<pre>
rake spec
</pre>

If all of the RSpec tests are passing, try the Cucumber tests

<pre>
rake cucumber
</pre>

If you have all of the RSpec and Cucumber tests passing, then the application is installed correctly.

Now run the rails lighttpd server

<pre>
script/server
</pre>

If all goes well, you will be able to see an empty copy of hydrangea at http://localhost:3000

h3. Create the sample user "archivist1"

The fixture objects are set up to control permissions for a user named archivist1.  To create this user, click "login" then click "create one" and create a new user named archivist1 with whatever password you want.  Now when you log in as archivist1 you will be able to see more records and you will be able to edit some of them.

h3. Stopping the server when you're done

To stop the rails app, press ctl+c in the window where you ran script/server

To stop jetty, use the rake task
<pre>
  rake hydra:jetty:stop
</pre>

h3. Design & Strategic Contributions

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia and University of Hull.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, and Chris Awre.  

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
