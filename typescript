RESPONSE: {"response"=>{"start"=>0, "docs"=>[{"abstract_t"=>["The main purposes of this study are to ascertain whether Jordan's accounting systems (enterprise, government, social) provide the necessary information for its socio- economic development planning and to suggest means by which to improve accounting in the country. An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "title_t"=>["The evolution of accounting in developing countries : the study of Jordan"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "organization_1_namePart_t"=>["Islamic University of Gaza"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice.

Here, they can communicate, share and learn informally using knowledge systems their elders can barely understand. Some of their contemporaries have turned away altogether, rejecting school and contributing to record levels of truancy and exclusion. This paper identifies a set of challenges for school leaders in relation to the growing digital/cultural gap.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "title_t"=>["The evolution of accounting in developing countries : the study of Jordan"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice. Possible explanations for these findings and their subsequent impact on practice are discussed together with suggestions for future study."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T11:43:22.517Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Medicine"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Sharp, Donald"], "title_t"=>["An investigation of the factors which influence the degree of patient involvement in the physiotherapeutic consultation"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Klaber Moffett, Jennifer"], "id"=>"hull:756", "organization_0_namePart_t"=>["Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Green, Angela Jane"], "person_1_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "organization_0_role_t"=>["Sponsor"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_2_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Medicine", "Medicine"]}, {"genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:44.777Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management Finance Taxation"], "title_t"=>["Accounting regulation in Egypt in relation to western influence"], "id"=>"hull:3112", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Kayed, Metwally Ahmed El-Sayed"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Management", "Finance", "Taxation", "Management", "Finance", "Taxation"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"]}], "numFound"=>6}, "responseHeader"=>{"QTime"=>10, "params"=>{"f.object_type_facet.facet.limit"=>"11", "fq"=>"{!raw f=object_type_facet}Thesis or dissertation", "f.personal_name_part_facet.facet.limit"=>"11", "qt"=>"search", "f.language_lang_code_facet.facet.limit"=>"11", "spellcheck.q"=>"_query_:\"{!dismax qf=$qf_dismax pf=$pf_dismax}\" AND NOT _query_:\"info\\\\:fedora/afmodel\\\\:FileAsset\" AND (_query_:\"edit_access_group_t:public\" OR _query_:\"discover_access_group_t:public\" OR _query_:\"read_access_group_t:public\" OR _query_:\"edit_access_group_t:contentAccessTeam\" OR _query_:\"discover_access_group_t:contentAccessTeam\" OR _query_:\"read_access_group_t:contentAccessTeam\" OR _query_:\"edit_access_person_t:contentAccessTeam1\" OR _query_:\"discover_access_person_t:contentAccessTeam1\" OR _query_:\"read_access_person_t:contentAccessTeam1\") OR  ((_query_:\"embargo_release_date_dt:[NOW TO *]\" AND  _query_:\"depositor_t:contentAccessTeam1\") AND NOT (NOT _query_:\"depositor_t:contentAccessTeam1\" AND _query_:\"embargo_release_date_dt:[NOW TO *]\"))", "facet.field"=>["object_type_facet", "subject_topic_facet", "personal_name_part_facet", "language_lang_code_facet", "is_member_of_queue_facet"], "f.subject_topic_facet.facet.limit"=>"11", "q"=>"_query_:\"{!dismax qf=$qf_dismax pf=$pf_dismax}\" AND NOT _query_:\"info\\\\:fedora/afmodel\\\\:FileAsset\" AND (_query_:\"edit_access_group_t:public\" OR _query_:\"discover_access_group_t:public\" OR _query_:\"read_access_group_t:public\" OR _query_:\"edit_access_group_t:contentAccessTeam\" OR _query_:\"discover_access_group_t:contentAccessTeam\" OR _query_:\"read_access_group_t:contentAccessTeam\" OR _query_:\"edit_access_person_t:contentAccessTeam1\" OR _query_:\"discover_access_person_t:contentAccessTeam1\" OR _query_:\"read_access_person_t:contentAccessTeam1\") OR  ((_query_:\"embargo_release_date_dt:[NOW TO *]\" AND  _query_:\"depositor_t:contentAccessTeam1\") AND NOT (NOT _query_:\"depositor_t:contentAccessTeam1\" AND _query_:\"embargo_release_date_dt:[NOW TO *]\"))", "wt"=>"ruby", "rows"=>"10"}, "status"=>0}, "facet_counts"=>{"facet_fields"=>{"personal_name_part_facet"=>["Al-Rashed, Wael E.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "organization_1_namePart_t"=>["Islamic University of Gaza"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice. Possible explanations for these findings and their subsequent impact on practice are discussed together with suggestions for future study."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Sharp, Donald"], "subject_t"=>["Medicine"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T11:43:22.517Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Klaber Moffett, Jennifer"], "title_t"=>["An investigation of the factors which influence the degree of patient involvement in the physiotherapeutic consultation"], "person_1_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Green, Angela Jane"], "organization_0_namePart_t"=>["Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"], "id"=>"hull:756", "subject_topic_t"=>["Medicine", "Medicine"], "person_2_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "organization_0_role_t"=>["Sponsor"]}>, #<SolrDocument:0x7505378 @solr_response=nil, @export_formats={:dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :oai_dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :xml=>{:content_type=>"application/xml"}}, @_source={"has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "subject_t"=>["Management Finance Taxation"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:44.777Z", "title_t"=>["Accounting regulation in Egypt in relation to western influence"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Kayed, Metwally Ahmed El-Sayed"], "id"=>"hull:3112", "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Management", "Finance", "Taxation", "Management", "Finance", "Taxation"]}>]

RESPONSE: {"response"=>{"start"=>0, "docs"=>[{"abstract_t"=>["The main purposes of this study are to ascertain whether Jordan's accounting systems (enterprise, government, social) provide the necessary information for its socio- economic development planning and to suggest means by which to improve accounting in the country. An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "title_t"=>["The evolution of accounting in developing countries : the study of Jordan"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice. Possible explanations for these findings and their subsequent impact on practice are discussed together with suggestions for future study."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T11:43:22.517Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Medicine"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Sharp, Donald"], "title_t"=>["An investigation of the factors which influence the degree of patient involvement in the physiotherapeutic consultation"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Klaber Moffett, Jennifer"], "id"=>"hull:756", "organization_0_namePart_t"=>["Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Green, Angela Jane"], "person_1_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "organization_0_role_t"=>["Sponsor"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_2_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Medicine", "Medicine"]}, {"has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:presentation"], "genre_t"=>["Presentation"], "person_4_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_3_namePart_t"=>["Sadler, Bess"], "person_5_role_t"=>["creator"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:57:03.333Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "person_3_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_t"=>["Hydra OR10 Repositories"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Mene, Willy"], "title_t"=>["Hydra : a technical and community framework for customised, shared repository applications"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["McRae, Lynn"], "id"=>"hull:2653", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Cramer, Tom"], "person_7_namePart_t"=>["Staples, Thornton"], "person_1_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_6_namePart_t"=>["Sigmon, Tim"], "person_2_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Hydra", "OR10", "Repositories"], "person_5_namePart_t"=>["Green, Richard A."], "person_7_role_t"=>["creator"], "description_t"=>["A presentation given during the main track of the Open Repositories 2010 conference held in Madrid in July 2010."], "person_4_namePart_t"=>["Awre, Christopher L."], "person_6_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:44.777Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management Finance Taxation"], "title_t"=>["Accounting regulation in Egypt in relation to western influence"], "id"=>"hull:3112", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Kayed, Metwally Ahmed El-Sayed"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Management", "Finance", "Taxation", "Management", "Finance", "Taxation"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"abstract_t"=>["Between April 2005 and March 2009, the e-Services Integration Group at the University of Hull undertook two Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)-funded projects, RepoMMan and REMAP.

It went on to look at the processes involved in publishing such works to a public-facing repository and to investigate the possibility of generating metadata for the published object automatically. The follow-on REMAP Project implemented the publishing process and also investigated how triggers might be embedded in the objects that were created which would help with management and possible preservation of the object over time.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "organization_1_namePart_t"=>["Islamic University of Gaza"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice. Possible explanations for these findings and their subsequent impact on practice are discussed together with suggestions for future study."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Sharp, Donald"], "subject_t"=>["Medicine"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T11:43:22.517Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Klaber Moffett, Jennifer"], "title_t"=>["An investigation of the factors which influence the degree of patient involvement in the physiotherapeutic consultation"], "person_1_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Green, Angela Jane"], "organization_0_namePart_t"=>["Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"], "id"=>"hull:756", "subject_topic_t"=>["Medicine", "Medicine"], "person_2_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "organization_0_role_t"=>["Sponsor"]}>, #<SolrDocument:0x792d450 @solr_response=nil, @export_formats={:dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :oai_dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :xml=>{:content_type=>"application/xml"}}, @_source={"person_5_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_3_namePart_t"=>["Sadler, Bess"], "person_4_role_t"=>["creator"], "genre_t"=>["Presentation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:presentation"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Mene, Willy"], "subject_t"=>["Hydra OR10 Repositories"], "person_3_role_t"=>["creator"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:57:03.333Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["McRae, Lynn"], "title_t"=>["Hydra : a technical and community framework for customised, shared repository applications"], "person_1_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_7_namePart_t"=>["Staples, Thornton"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Cramer, Tom"], "id"=>"hull:2653", "subject_topic_t"=>["Hydra", "OR10", "Repositories"], "person_2_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_6_namePart_t"=>["Sigmon, Tim"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_7_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_5_namePart_t"=>["Green, Richard A."], "person_4_namePart_t"=>["Awre, Christopher L."], "description_t"=>["A presentation given during the main track of the Open Repositories 2010 conference held in Madrid in July 2010."], "person_6_role_t"=>["creator"]}>, #<SolrDocument:0x792a458 @solr_response=nil, @export_formats={:dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :oai_dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :xml=>{:content_type=>"application/xml"}}, @_source={"has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "subject_t"=>["Management Finance Taxation"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:44.777Z", "title_t"=>["Accounting regulation in Egypt in relation to western influence"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Kayed, Metwally Ahmed El-Sayed"], "id"=>"hull:3112", "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Management", "Finance", "Taxation", "Management", "Finance", "Taxation"]}>, #<SolrDocument:0x7927938 @solr_response=nil, @export_formats={:dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :oai_dc_xml=>{:content_type=>"text/xml"}, :xml=>{:content_type=>"application/xml"}}, @_source={"abstract_t"=>["Between April 2005 and March 2009, the e-Services Integration Group at the University of Hull undertook two Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)-funded projects, RepoMMan and REMAP.

The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice. Possible explanations for these findings and their subsequent impact on practice are discussed together with suggestions for future study."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T11:43:22.517Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Medicine"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Sharp, Donald"], "title_t"=>["An investigation of the factors which influence the degree of patient involvement in the physiotherapeutic consultation"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Klaber Moffett, Jennifer"], "id"=>"hull:756", "organization_0_namePart_t"=>["Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Green, Angela Jane"], "person_1_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "organization_0_role_t"=>["Sponsor"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_2_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Medicine", "Medicine"]}, {"has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:presentation"], "genre_t"=>["Presentation"], "person_4_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_3_namePart_t"=>["Sadler, Bess"], "person_5_role_t"=>["creator"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:57:03.333Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "person_3_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_t"=>["Hydra OR10 Repositories"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Mene, Willy"], "title_t"=>["Hydra : a technical and community framework for customised, shared repository applications"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["McRae, Lynn"], "id"=>"hull:2653", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Cramer, Tom"], "person_7_namePart_t"=>["Staples, Thornton"], "person_1_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_6_namePart_t"=>["Sigmon, Tim"], "person_2_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Hydra", "OR10", "Repositories"], "person_5_namePart_t"=>["Green, Richard A."], "person_7_role_t"=>["creator"], "description_t"=>["A presentation given during the main track of the Open Repositories 2010 conference held in Madrid in July 2010."], "person_4_namePart_t"=>["Awre, Christopher L."], "person_6_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:44.777Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management Finance Taxation"], "title_t"=>["Accounting regulation in Egypt in relation to western influence"], "id"=>"hull:3112", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Kayed, Metwally Ahmed El-Sayed"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Management", "Finance", "Taxation", "Management", "Finance", "Taxation"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"abstract_t"=>["Between April 2005 and March 2009, the e-Services Integration Group at the University of Hull undertook two Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)-funded projects, RepoMMan and REMAP.

It went on to look at the processes involved in publishing such works to a public-facing repository and to investigate the possibility of generating metadata for the published object automatically. The follow-on REMAP Project implemented the publishing process and also investigated how triggers might be embedded in the objects that were created which would help with management and possible preservation of the object over time. The work of RepoMMan and REMAP has now been taken up in an international collaboration, the Hydra Project, which seeks to develop a repository-enabled Scholars Workbench.

To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist.

In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "title_t"=>["Kuwait's tax reformation, its alternatives and impact on a developing accounting profession"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer.

It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result.

It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "title_t"=>["The evolution of accounting in developing countries : the study of Jordan"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice. Possible explanations for these findings and their subsequent impact on practice are discussed together with suggestions for future study."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T11:43:22.517Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Medicine"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Sharp, Donald"], "title_t"=>["An investigation of the factors which influence the degree of patient involvement in the physiotherapeutic consultation"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Klaber Moffett, Jennifer"], "id"=>"hull:756", "organization_0_namePart_t"=>["Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"], "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Green, Angela Jane"], "person_1_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "organization_0_role_t"=>["Sponsor"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_2_role_t"=>["Thesis advisor"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Medicine", "Medicine"]}, {"has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:presentation"], "genre_t"=>["Presentation"], "person_4_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_3_namePart_t"=>["Sadler, Bess"], "person_5_role_t"=>["creator"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:57:03.333Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "person_3_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_t"=>["Hydra OR10 Repositories"], "person_2_namePart_t"=>["Mene, Willy"], "title_t"=>["Hydra : a technical and community framework for customised, shared repository applications"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["McRae, Lynn"], "id"=>"hull:2653", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Cramer, Tom"], "person_7_namePart_t"=>["Staples, Thornton"], "person_1_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"], "person_6_namePart_t"=>["Sigmon, Tim"], "person_2_role_t"=>["creator"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Hydra", "OR10", "Repositories"], "person_5_namePart_t"=>["Green, Richard A."], "person_7_role_t"=>["creator"], "description_t"=>["A presentation given during the main track of the Open Repositories 2010 conference held in Madrid in July 2010."], "person_4_namePart_t"=>["Awre, Christopher L."], "person_6_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:44.777Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Management Finance Taxation"], "title_t"=>["Accounting regulation in Egypt in relation to western influence"], "id"=>"hull:3112", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Kayed, Metwally Ahmed El-Sayed"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Management", "Finance", "Taxation", "Management", "Finance", "Taxation"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"abstract_t"=>["Between April 2005 and March 2009, the e-Services Integration Group at the University of Hull undertook two Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)-funded projects, RepoMMan and REMAP.

The follow-on REMAP Project implemented the publishing process and also investigated how triggers might be embedded in the objects that were created which would help with management and possible preservation of the object over time. The work of RepoMMan and REMAP has now been taken up in an international collaboration, the Hydra Project, which seeks to develop a repository-enabled Scholars Workbench.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "title_t"=>["Kuwait's tax reformation, its alternatives and impact on a developing accounting profession"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer.

It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result.

It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "title_t"=>["Kuwait's tax reformation, its alternatives and impact on a developing accounting profession"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Here, they can communicate, share and learn informally using knowledge systems their elders can barely understand.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result. It is concluded that a diversity of partnerships will emerge for the capture and transfer of knowledge, combining expertise from the economy with the conceptual frameworks of the academy."], "genre_t"=>["Journal article"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:journalArticle"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-03-16T18:31:52.508Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["Forms of knowledge University futures Learning technologies Knowledge economy"], "title_t"=>["Valid knowledge: the economy and the academy", "Higher Education"], "id"=>"hull:2376", "person_0_namePart_t"=>["Williams, Peter"], "subject_topic_t"=>["Forms of knowledge", "University futures", "Learning technologies", "Knowledge economy", "Forms of knowledge", "University futures", "Learning technologies", "Knowledge economy"], "person_0_role_t"=>["creator"]}, {"abstract_t"=>["The main purposes of this study are to ascertain whether Jordan's accounting systems (enterprise, government, social) provide the necessary information for its socio- economic development planning and to suggest means by which to improve accounting in the country. An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result.

It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "title_t"=>["Kuwait's tax reformation, its alternatives and impact on a developing accounting profession"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

Here, they can communicate, share and learn informally using knowledge systems their elders can barely understand. Some of their contemporaries have turned away altogether, rejecting school and contributing to record levels of truancy and exclusion. This paper identifies a set of challenges for school leaders in relation to the growing digital/cultural gap.

Where in the past only propositional knowledge codified by academics was considered valid, in the new economy enabled by information and communications technology, the procedural knowledge of expertise has become a key commodity, and the acquisition of this expertise is increasingly seen as a priority by intending university students. Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer. This paper analyses pressures upon universities, their attempts to adapt to changing circumstances, and the institutional transformations which may result.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports.

Universities have traditionally proved adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is little evidence to date of their success in accommodating to the scale and unprecedented pace of change of the Knowledge Economy or to the new vocationally-oriented demands of their course clients. And in addition to these external factors, internal ones are now at work. Recent developments in eLearning have enabled the infiltration of commercial providers who are cherry-picking the most lucrative subject areas. The prospect is of a fracturing higher education system, with the less adaptable universities consigned to a shrinking public-funded sector supporting less vocationally saleable courses, and the more enterprising universities developing commercial partnerships in eLearning and knowledge transfer.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel.

However, in recent years the situation has changed, influencing the state budget and financial resources. The search for sources of income other than oil gave rise to the possibility of imposing taxes in a hitherto tax-free country. The 1955 tax law was applied only to foreign enterprises operating in Kuwait, and since then few attempts have been undertaken to reform it. The purpose of this study is to examine the tax alternatives available to Kuwait, which could increase state revenues, and reduce the level of inequality among the population resulting from the government land purchasing programme adopted in the early sixties. It also aims, through an empirical investigation, to reveal the potential impact of tax reformation on the development of the emerging accounting profession in Kuwait. The determination of the most appropriate tax policy for Kuwait necessitates the examination of the views of those parties most concerned, who are defined in this study as the public, foreign investors, and accounting practitioners. Accordingly, questionnaires were designed, tested, distributed and analysed to reveal attitudes towards tax reformation. In addition, interviews with concerned persons in the country, including tax legislators, officials, and authors, were conducted, so as to further examine these attitudes and other aspects of tax introduction. Based on the findings of this investigation as well as the traditional literature survey, appropriate reforms are suggested, including reformation in the legislative, administrative, and technical considerations of the tax introduction. Moreover, recommendations concerning the development of the accounting profession to accommodate the new tax era are also made, including better organisation of the profession, and its contribution to taxation in Kuwait."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["International trade Management Political science Public administration"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:52.446Z", "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Johnson, E.

An attempt is made to describe the Jordanian environment and to determine the possible orientation of accounting in Jordan. It is shown that Jordan is a developing country, which was and still is subject to pressure from foreign powers both politically and economically. This pressure has created a bias towards the U.K.! USA accounting systems. Laws and regulations, accounting education and the accounting profession, are oriented towards the accounting of these two countries. The study of accounting development in Jordan revealed that public accounting has not reached the stage where it can be recognised as a developed profession. The empirical study revealed that the most important items needed to improve national accounting practices are as follows: (1) an active accounting organisation; (2) accounting principles suitable to the Jordanian environment; (3) official auditing pronouncements; and (4) a code of professional conduct. The empirical survey revealed the inadequacy and unsuitability of current reporting practices to the needs of the local users of financial reports. It also identified the following as major problems facing accounting profession in Jordan: (1) shortage of qualified accountants; (2) weakness and underdevelopment of the Jordanian accounting curricula; and (3) lack of sufficiently qualified teaching staff. Several recommendations are made concerning the development of the accounting profession and education so they can meet the challenge of economic development. These recommendations call for improvement in accounting practices, organisation of the profession, coordination of efforts with government, and increase in contacts with accountants in other countries."], "genre_t"=>["Thesis or dissertation"], "has_model_s"=>["info:fedora/hull-cModel:uketdObject"], "subject_t"=>["Management"], "language_lang_text_t"=>["English"], "system_create_dt"=>"2011-02-23T10:50:50.034Z", "organization_1_namePart_t"=>["Islamic University of Gaza"], "person_1_namePart_t"=>["Briston, R.

Little is known about NHS physiotherapists’ attitudes, knowledge or skills regarding patient involvement. The aims of this thesis were therefore to: i) identify the attributes which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy using a method of concept analysis; ii) investigate physiotherapists’ attitudes towards the involvement of patients by means of a national survey; iii) explore patients’ attitudes towards their involvement in the physiotherapy consultation using a local survey; iv) explore physiotherapists’ ability to recognise effective practice in patient involvement by means of a regional study using video vignettes of simulated consultations; v) ascertain to what extent physiotherapists involve patients in their physiotherapy care by means of an in-depth local observational study. A review of published literature was conducted. This focussed on physiotherapy researchers’, patients’ and other healthcare professionals’ use of the term patient involvement. From this review, seven attributes were identified which define the concept of patient involvement in physiotherapy for the purpose of this thesis. No published instruments could be found which incorporated the above attributes and were validated for use by physiotherapists and their patients. Four instruments were developed for the purpose of this thesis: Physiotherapists’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-A) questionnaire; a matched questionnaire to investigate Patients’ Attitudes towards Patient Involvement (PAPI-B); Vignette Evaluation Sheet, to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge of patient involvement; Patient Involvement in physiotherapy Evaluation (PIE) tool, a rating tool to assess video- recorded physiotherapy consultations. A national survey of 735 physiotherapists found that 48% of physiotherapists agreed with all aspects of patient involvement, as measured by the PAPI-A. Almost 75% of physiotherapists agreed with all items on the “involvement in treatment planning” sub-scale, whilst 78% agreed with all items on the “exploration of the patient’s perspective of their problem” sub-scale. Stepwise linear regression models explained less than 12% of variance in the PAPI-A scores. Being of female gender or having accessed the survey through the interactive CSP website predicted higher scores in the PAPI-A and its sub-scales. Seventy six patients responded to a local survey of patients’ attitudes towards involvement. Forty four percent of those patients agreed with all PAPI-B items. The PAPI-B had three sub-scales: 84% of patients agreed with all items regarding the importance of having a “therapeutic relationship with the physiotherapist”; 74% believed that they should be “involved in treatment planning”; whilst 77% believed that the physiotherapist should “explore the patient’s perspective of their problem”. Cohabitation with a partner/spouse was predictive of a lower PAPI-B score. Physiotherapists’ and patients’ beliefs differed regarding what they considered to be the most important aspects of patient involvement. Physiotherapists from nine NHS Trusts (n=257) watched three video vignettes of a simulated physiotherapy consultation, and rated how well the physiotherapist involved the patient. Respondents’ ratings were compared with those of an expert panel. Thirty physiotherapists (12%) achieved total agreement with the expert panel, whilst 58% (n=147) of physiotherapists’ knowledge was considered to be within acceptable limits. The odds of achieving an acceptable knowledge score were, on average, 2.6 times higher for physiotherapists aged between 26 and 30 years. To investigate how well physiotherapists encourage their patients’ involvement during the clinical consultation, 20 physiotherapists representing three clinical areas, were recorded in consultation with 76 out-patients; approximately 4 consultations per physiotherapist. No physiotherapist achieved an acceptable score in all 36 PIE items. Six physiotherapists (30%) were considered to have made a reasonable attempt to involve their patients, on the basis that they were observed to have performed at least half of the PIE items to an acceptable or good standard. In conclusion, this research suggests that most physiotherapists have a positive attitude towards patient involvement; fewer seem able to recognise it in practice and a much smaller proportion are able to implement it to an acceptable standard in their clinical practice.
