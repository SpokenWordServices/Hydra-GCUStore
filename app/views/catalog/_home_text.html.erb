		<h3>About Hydra</h3>
			The Hydra project is developing a new repository for digital materials at the University of Hull.  This will eventually replace the beta-test eDocs system that has been trialled for some time. The new repository can hold and manage any type of digital material, and is being developed in response to the growth in the amount of digital material that is generated through the research, education and administrative activities within the University. The repository is particularly well suited for materials that can be shared (openly or on a restricted basis) and/or where the material needs to be preserved for the medium to long-term. Materials currently being managed through the eDocs repository include images, project reports, undergraduate dissertations, teaching materials, datasets, collections of past exam papers and doctoral theses.
			<p>The repository is being developed by Academic Services at the University working in close co-operation with other members of  the academic community.</p>
