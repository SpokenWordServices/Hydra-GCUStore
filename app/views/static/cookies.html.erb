 <h1>Cookies</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>To help us manage the Spoken Word site, we sometimes place small data files on
        your computer. These are known as cookies. Most  websites do this.</p>

        <p>They improve things by:</p>

        <ul>
		  <li>remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them
          whenever you visit a new page</li>
          <li>measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets
          your needs</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Our cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just
        here to make the site work better for you. Indeed, you can manage
        and/or delete these small files as you wish.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How we use cookies</h1>

        <p>Spoken Word  uses cookies in several places – we’ve listed each of them
        below with more details about why we use them and how long they will
        last.</p>

        <h3 id="analyticscookies">Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use
        this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to
        understand how we could do it better.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how
        long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. We do
        not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or
        address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.  We
        do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.</p>
